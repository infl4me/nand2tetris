# Build a Modern Computer from First Principles (Part 1)

https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer

The Nand to Tetris course takes you on a self-paced fascinating voyage of discovery in which you will go all the way from Boolean algebra and elementary logic gates to building a Central Processing Unit, a memory system, and a hardware platform, leading up to a general-purpose computer that can run any program that you fancy. In the process of building this computer you will become familiar with many important hardware abstractions, and you will implement them, hands on. But most of all, you will enjoy the tremendous thrill of building a complex and useful system from the ground up.

### The course homework consists of a series 6 projects:

- Project 1: Building elementary logic gates like And, Or, Not, Multiplexor, and more
- Project 2: Building a family of adder chips, culminating in the construction of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Project 3: Building registers and memory units, culminating in the construction of a Random Access Memory (RAM)
- Project 4: Learning a machine language and using it to write some illustrative low-level programs
- Project 5: Using the chipset built in projects 1-3 to build a Central Processing Unit (CPU) and a hardware platform capable of executing programs written in the machine language introduced in project 4
- Project 6: Developing an assembler, i.e. a capability to translate programs written in symbolic machine language into binary, executable code.



# Build a Modern Computer from First Principles (Part 2)

In this project-centered course you will build a modern software hierarchy, designed to enable the translation and execution of object-based, high-level languages on a bare-bone computer hardware platform. In particular, you will implement a virtual machine and a compiler for a simple, Java-like programming language, and you will develop a basic operating system that closes gaps between the high-level language and the underlying hardware platform. In the process, you will gain a deep, hands-on understanding of numerous topics in applied computer science, e.g. stack processing, parsing, code generation, and classical algorithms and data structures for memory management, vector graphics, input-output handling, and various other topics that lie at the very core of every modern computer system.

### The course homework consists of a series 6 projects:

- Project 7: Build a basic VM translator, focusing on the implementation of the VM language's stack arithmetic and memory accesscommands. In Project 8, this basic translator will be extended into a full-scale VM translator.
- Project 8: Extend the basic VM translator built in project 7 into a full-scale VM translator. In particular, in project 7 we focused on handling the stack arithmetic and memory access commands of the VM language. We now turn to handle the VM language's branching and function calling commands.
- Project 9: Adopt or invent an application idea like a simple computer game or some other interactive program. Examples include Tetris, Snake, Hangman, Space Invaders, Sokoban, Pong, etc. Your job is to implement this application in Jack.
- Project 10: In this project we build a syntax analyzer that parses Jack programs according to the Jack grammar, producing an XML file that renders the program's structure using marked-up text. In the next project, the logic that generates the XML output will be morphed into logic that generates VM code.
- Project 11: In this project we complete the construction of the Jack Compiler that we started building in the previous project.
- Project 12: Implement the Jack OS specified in Chapter 12. In the process of building this OS, you will implement a modular collection of some beautiful algorithms in applied computer science. Thus, you will also be exposed, hands-on, to some cool computer science stuff.
